* A smart contract is a program that is stored on a blockchain and that executes
when predetermined conditions are met. The code contained in it controls the execution, and
  transactions are made trackable but irreversible
  
* To provide private and confidential transactions on the private blockchain network, channels are created where only peers of 
  invited organizations can store the channel ledger and
  validate transactions on the channel. The channel is invisible to other memebers
  in the network
