* In the Fabric network, while peers validate 
  transactions and add blocks to the blockchain ledger, 
  a separate orderer organization manages the order of 
  transactions, since it will be costly to maintain consensus by peers 
  themselves.
  
* To maintain privacy in the private blockchain, channels are created where only peers of 
  invited organizations can store the channel ledger and
  validate transactions on the channel. The channel is invisible to other memebers
  in the network
